### What I learned

This is one of my first self-taught challenges. Completing it without assistance brought me a great sense of joy. I'm eager to continue progressing and conquering Frontend challenges with enthusiasm.


### Continued development

In this challenge, I only implemented HTML and CSS, seeking to strengthen my existing knowledge and foundations. I am eager to improve in Tailwind, and I have the desire to refine my skills in JavaScript. I will continue to focus my future projects on the aforementioned technologies.
